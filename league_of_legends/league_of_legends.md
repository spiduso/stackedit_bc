# League of Legends - Riot games game too

  League of Legends is another game developed by Riot Games.

## Issues with ranked for pro players

- high latency, especially in North America[^NAping] as a region - low latency is crucial for fast reactions and to simulate LAN ping as close as possible
- players play champions that are not in META[^META] - non-pro players sometimes play champions that are not in META because they just enjoy them and they play them for fun
- "one-trick ponies" - one-trick ponies are players that play only one champion that may or may not be in the META, they pick the champion even if the champion is not ideal for increasing the chance of winning the game
- no voice communication tool -  success in League of Legends is heavily based on strategy and team coordination, yet there are only pings and text messages available for team communication.
- skill gap between pro players and casual players
- stream-sniping is not as effective as in FPS games, where information is huge part of the game, but still common and streamers have to hide their minimap
- huge issue with intentional feeding for win-trading[^wintrading] purposes in Korean region by players from China. The issue was so bad that Riot Korea had to intervene and implement a system to block Chinese players from playing on Korean servers and they established a hotline between Riot Korea and LCK teams for reporting suspicious players. Two years prior to this issue, boosting in South Korea in online games carries a two-year suspended jail term and a fine of up to $18,000 thanks to a legislation enacted by the National Assembly of South Korea[^NASK].

[^META]: META is acronym for most effective tactic available. Pro players usually just play sets of champions that are in META as a practice for real matches.

[^wintrading]: Win-trading is two players queueing on purpose at the same time so they can play against each other and one of them is throwing the game on purpose so the other one gets a free win.

## Champions Queue

Champions Queue is a matchmaking developed for pro players and special invitees by Riot Games[^CQ]. Players that were not invited can apply. Matchmaking takes place on private Discord server and is fully automated. To further improve on competitiveness, Champions Queue in 2022, when it was first launched in North America, Riot announced that Champions Queue will have a $400,000 prize pool. Riot also dedicated a special west coast server, where North American pro player teams are located, to ensure low latency that is as low as on real matches. Champions Queue is open only in specific times, tailored for pro players and their busy practice and scrim schedule.

### Pros

- voice communication on Discord
- games with only champions in META
- players do not have to fill positions like in Solo Queue
- low latency
- automated bot[^tweet] that tweets about games, which boost players' streams if they decide to stream it
- almost[^almost] no toxicity

[^almost]: Pro players are still people and sometimes two people just do not mesh well together, like Zven and rjs recently had a drama where Zven did not like how rjs played and when he was matched to play with him, Zven left the queue thus aborting the game. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXEJsnuXzYw>

### Cons

- lack of motivation after practice and scrims - pro players have very busy practice schedule and after practice and scrims, some players lack motivation to play more games
- long queue time because of the small pool of players[^spring2023] - mostly only pro players and because some of them don't play at all, players have to wait quite a while for a game
- skill gap between pro players in the prestigious leagues and players in collegiate teams or less prestigious teams.
