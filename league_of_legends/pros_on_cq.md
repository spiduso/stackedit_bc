# Opinions of pro players on Champions Queue

- DL on CQ - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc-mHmriOew> (learning from LCS/experienced players, 30-40 mins queue),
<https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/16501/lcs-players-share-their-initial-thoughts-on-champions-queue>
- jojopyun - soloQ -> high ping, bad teammates/trolls => unable to improve, CQ -> everyone is taking it seriously
- Destiny - realistic drafts (no one trick ponies), bad queue times, improving comms
- Santorin - one sided games -> 4 LCS players 1 amateur vs 4 amateurs vs 1 LCS player (exakick said the same <https://twitter.com/Exakicklol/status/1623625944647827456>)
- Summit - comparable to the LCK soloQ
- Keiaduo - still played soloQ to get #1
- jankos - within EMEA leagues are competing in different patches (<https://clips.twitch.tv/TrustworthyCuriousNikudonSquadGoals-caxasg-JdZfv6Pvq> clip from <https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1753650537> 01:11:36)
