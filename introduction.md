Famous Valorant[^1] streamer Tarik (former CS:GO pro player) was upset playing competitive mode in Valorant while live-streaming on Twitch. Some of his teammates were repetitively in his games and did not perform on the level expected from their rank. Later on he was convinced that he was being queue-sniped and stream-sniped because of a new dark sensation called crypto-throwing. Tarik decided to create a Discord server called Pro City with pro Valorant players and other players he trusted to build a third-party matchmaking system. For Discord matchmaking he chose famous NeatQueue which is currently serving over 3000 servers with total of 135640 players thanks to its robustness and flexibility across games. Because of previously listed features, NeatQueue is not optimized for Valorant matchmaking and especially for Pro City needs. For this reason I chose to create a Discord Bot optimized for needs of Pro City to ensure fast queues and maximum enjoyment not only for players, but also for viewers of players' streams.
