# Map mechanics

Each map on Valorant website has a introduction message hinting an unique mechanic, which is unique or introduced for the first time. Breeze introduction message is hinting open spaces and long engagement which cannot be the unique mechanic in my opinion. Breeze does have a trap door which is not present in any of current maps.

| Map       | Unique mechanic               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bind      | one-way teleporters           |
| Split     | first vertical zip-line       |
| Haven     | first with 3 sites            |
| Ascent    | breakable moving doors        |
| Icebox    | first horizontal zip-line     |
| Breeze    | trap door (?)                 |
| Fracture  | split spawn attacker's site   |
| Pearl     | no mechanics                  |
| Lotus     | revolving doors               |
