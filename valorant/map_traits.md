# Map mechanics

Each map on Valorant website has a introduction message hinting an unique mechanic, which is unique or introduced for the first time[^first].

| Map       | Unique mechanic               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bind      | one-way teleporters           |
| Split     | first vertical zip-line       |
| Haven     | first with 3 sites            |
| Ascent    | breakable horizontally moving doors        |
| Icebox    | first horizontal zip-line     |
| Breeze    | trap door[^guess]             |
| Fracture  | split spawn attacker's site   |
| Pearl     | no mechanics                  |
| Lotus     | revolving doors               |

[^first]: Mechanics marked as *first* are mechanics that used to be unique but not anymore, because they were introduced in newer maps too.

[^guess]: Breeze introduction message is hinting open spaces and long engagement which cannot be the unique mechanic in my opinion. But Breeze does have a trap door which is not present in any of current maps.
