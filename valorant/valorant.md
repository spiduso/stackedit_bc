- Issues with Valorant and streaming
- smurfing
- queue sniping
	- valorant added name hiding -> prevents people in-game to recognize streamer and then go stream snipe, but does not prevent the other way around
- stream sniping
	- sniping is still a thing because no one can confirm sniping
	- players hide minimap
- crypto throwing
	- betting sites are not public, since its against valorant rules and thats why we can sometimes only see tweets about it
