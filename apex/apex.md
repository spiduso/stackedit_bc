### Cons

- weekly elo reset - since elo determine how good ur teammates and enemies are, not optimal - since huge skill gap between the best and players at the bottom of the leaderboard
- can easily gain advantage by stream-sniping - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w60aNIJ-FUU>, <https://twitter.com/therealm_gg/status/1649075901899087873>
- not perfect for pro players
  - OTP - <https://twitter.com/rambrro7/status/1647026340607012867>
  - skill difference
  - only soloQ -> coordination is very important
  - big prizepool

## Similarity to Fortnite

- Fortnite is conceptually similar game but doesn't have any solution (<https://twitter.com/FNPPA>)
  - Streamer banned during Fortnite Champions Series because of a stream-sniper
    - Epic banned both for 14 days because of teaming up in a solo battle royale game
